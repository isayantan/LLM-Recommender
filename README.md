# LLM-Recommender

- In this project we want to design a recommendation system which uses Large Languange Models. 

- A recommendation system (or recommender system) is a type of algorithm or model designed to predict the preferences or interests of users by analyzing data. It suggests items (such as products, movies, music, or content) that are likely to be of interest to a particular user, based on their past behaviors or the behaviors of other similar users.
