# LLM-Recommender

In this project we want to develop a recommendation system which uses Large Languange Models. 

### Recommendation System 
A recommendation system (or recommender system) is a type of algorithm or model designed to predict the preferences or interests of users by analyzing data. It suggests items (such as products, movies, music, or content) that are likely to be of interest to a particular user, based on their past behaviors or the behaviors of other similar users.

### Applications
- E-commerce: Suggesting products based on browsing and purchase history (e.g., Amazon).
- Streaming Services: Recommending movies, TV shows, or music based on viewing or listening history (e.g., Netflix, Spotify).
- Social Media: Suggesting people to follow or content to view based on user activity and interests (e.g., Facebook, YouTube).
- Online Advertising: Recommending ads or content to users based on their behavior and demographic data (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook Ads).
